# ImageBuilder

Building an embedded virtualized system with anything more than one
Domain can be difficult, error prone and time consuming.

ImageBuilder, an Open Source collection of scripts (contributions
encouraged), changes all that.

ImageBuilder generates a U-Boot script that can be used to load all of
the binaries automatically and boot the full system fast.Â Given a
collection of binaries such as Xen, Dom0 and a number of Dom0-less
DomUs, ImageBuilder takes care of calculating all loading addresses,
editing device tree with the necessary information, and even
pre-configuring a disk image with kernels and rootfses.

ImageBuilder has been tested on Xilinx ZynqMP MPSoC boards. An
up-to-date wikipage is also available at
[wiki.xenproject.org](https://wiki.xenproject.org/index.php?title=ImageBuilder).


## scripts/uboot-script-gen

The ImageBuilder script that generates a u-boot script to load all your
binaries for a Xen Dom0-less setup is `scripts/uboot-script-gen`.

To use it, first write a config file like `config`:

```
MEMORY_START="0x0"
MEMORY_END="0x80000000"

DEVICE_TREE="mpsoc.dtb"
XEN="xen"
XEN_CMD="console=dtuart dtuart=serial0 dom0_mem=1G dom0_max_vcpus=1 bootscrub=0 vwfi=native sched=null"
DOM0_KERNEL="Image-dom0"
DOM0_CMD="console=hvc0 earlycon=xen earlyprintk=xen clk_ignore_unused"
DOM0_RAMDISK="dom0-ramdisk.cpio"

NUM_DOMUS=2
DOMU_KERNEL[0]="zynqmp-dom1/Image-domU"
DOMU_RAMDISK[0]="zynqmp-dom1/domU-ramdisk.cpio"
DOMU_PASSTHROUGH_DTB[0]="zynqmp-dom1/passthrough-example-part.dtb"
DOMU_KERNEL[1]="zynqmp-dom2/Image-domU"
DOMU_RAMDISK[1]="zynqmp-dom2/domU-ramdisk.cpio"
DOMU_MEM[1]=512
DOMU_VCPUS[1]=1

UBOOT_SOURCE="boot.source"
UBOOT_SCRIPT="boot.scr"
FDTEDIT="imagebuilder.dtb"
```

Where:
- MEMORY_START and MEMORY_END specify the start and end of RAM.

- DEVICE_TREE specifies the DTB file to load.

- XEN specifies the Xen hypervisor binary to load. Note that it has to
  be a regular Xen binary, not a u-boot binary.

- XEN_CMD specifies the command line arguments used for Xen.  If not
  set, the default one will be used.

- DOM0_KERNEL specifies the Dom0 kernel file to load.

- DOM0_CMD specifies the command line arguments for Dom0's Linux
  kernel.  If "root=" isn't set, imagebuilder will try to determine it.
  If not set at all, the default one is used.

- DOM0_RAMDISK specifies the Dom0 ramdisk to use. Note that it should be
  a regular ramdisk cpio.gz file, not a u-boot binary.

- NUM_DOMUS specifies how many Dom0-less DomUs to load

- DOMU_KERNEL[number] specifies the DomU kernel to use.

- DOMU_CMD[number] specifies the command line arguments for Dom0's Linux
  kernel.  If "root=" isn't set, imagebuilder will try to determine it.
  If not set at all, the default one is used.

- DOMU_RAMDISK[number] specifies the DomU ramdisk to use.

- DOMU_PASSTHROUGH_DTB[number] specifies the device assignment
  configuration, see xen.git:docs/misc/arm/passthrough.txt

- DOMU_MEM[number] is the amount of memory for the VM in MB, default 512MB

- DOMU_VCPUS[number] is the number of vcpus for the VM, default 1

- DOMU_NOBOOT[number]: if specified, the DomU is not started
  automatically at boot as dom0-less guest. It can still be created
  later from Dom0.

- UBOOT_SOURCE and UBOOT_SCRIPT specify the output. They are optional
  as you can pass -o FILENAME to uboot-script-gen as a command line
  parameter

- FDTEDIT is an optional and is off by default.  Specifies the output
  modifited dtb, used for reference only.

Then you can invoke uboot-script-gen as follows:

```
$ bash ./scripts/uboot-script-gen -c /path/to/config-file -d . -t tftp -o bootscript
```

Where:\
-c specifies the path to the config file to use\
-d specifies the "root" directory (paths in the config file are relative
   to it), this is not a working directory (any output file locations
   are specified in the config and any temporary files are in /tmp)\
-t specifies the u-boot command to load the binaries. "tftp", "sd" and
   "scsi" are shorthands for "tftpb", "load mmc 0:1" and
   "load scsi 0:1", but actually any arbitrary command can be used, for
   instance -t "fatload" is valid.\
-o specifies the output filename for the uboot script and its source.\


## scripts/disk\_image

The ImageBuilder script that generates a disk image file to load on a SD
or SATA drive.  This creates multiple partitions: 1 boot partition where
the boot files from working directory (-c option) are, and 1 additional
partition for each Dom0/DomU cpio archive to write to disk.

disk\_image will write to disk as separate partition each file specified
as follows:

- DOM0_ROOTFS specifies the Dom0 rootfs to use.

- DOMU_ROOTFS[number] specifies the DomU rootfs to use.

The provided rootfs should not be a u-boot binary. The supported
formats are:

- cpio.gz
- tar.gz

After you've generated the u-boot scripts using the uboot-script-gen
script, disk_image is run as follows:

```
$ sudo bash ./scripts/disk_image -c /path/to/config-file -d . \
                                 -w /path/to/tmp/dir          \
                                 -o /path/to/output/disk.img  \
                                 -t "sd"
```

Where:\
-c specifies the path to the config file to use\
-d specifies the working directory (paths in the config file are relative
   to it)\
-w specifies the temporary working directory that the script uses for
   building the disk image, and if not set, one is created in /tmp\
-o specifies the output disk image file name\
-t specifies the u-boot command to load the binaries. "tftp", "sd" and
   "scsi" are shorthands for "tftpb", "load mmc 0:1" and
   "load scsi 0:1", but actually any arbitrary command can be used, for
   instance -t "fatload" is valid.


disk_image also generates on the fly a xl config file for each domU and
adds them to the dom0 rootfs partition under /etc/xen. It makes it
easier to start those domUs from dom0.
